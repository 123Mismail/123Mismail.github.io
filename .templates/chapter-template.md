# Chapter <NUMBER>: <Title>

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. [Action-oriented objective 1 using verbs like "implement", "derive", "analyze"]
2. [Action-oriented objective 2]
3. [Action-oriented objective 3]
4. [Optional: 4th and 5th objectives for complex chapters]

## Overview

[2-3 paragraphs introducing the chapter topic and its relevance to Physical AI and humanoid robotics. Explain how this chapter fits into the broader curriculum and what prerequisites are assumed.]

## Key Concepts

[Define 3-5 essential terms needed to understand this chapter. Bold each term on first use. Examples:]

- **[Term 1]**: [1-2 sentence definition with practical context]
- **[Term 2]**: [1-2 sentence definition with practical context]
- **[Term 3]**: [1-2 sentence definition with practical context]

## Main Content

### Section 1: [Primary Topic]

[Detailed explanation of the first major concept. Include technical depth with precise terminology. Reference official documentation where applicable.]

[Add subsections as needed for organization]

#### Subsection 1.1: [Subtopic]

[Content...]

### Section 2: [Secondary Topic]

[Content...]

## Code Examples

### Example 1: [Descriptive Title]

[Brief explanation of what this code demonstrates and its practical application]

```python
# Tested with ROS 2 Humble (verified via context7: YYYY-MM-DD)
# Description: [What this code does]
# Execution: ros2 run <package_name> <node_name>

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
# ... (include full, executable code - minimum 15 lines for substantive examples)

# [Inline comments explaining non-obvious logic]
```

**Key Points:**
- [Bullet point highlighting important aspect of code]
- [Another key point]

### Example 2: [Descriptive Title]

[Repeat structure for second example. Minimum 2 code examples per chapter.]

## Mathematical Foundations

### Equation 1: [Equation Name]

**Variables:**
- $x$: [Description with units, e.g., "position in meters [m]"]
- $\theta$: [Description]
- [Define all variables explicitly]

**Derivation:**

[Step-by-step derivation with intermediate steps numbered:]

1. Start with [initial equation or principle]
   $$
   [equation]
   $$

2. [Transformation step with justification]
   $$
   [equation]
   $$

3. [Continue until final result]

**Final Equation:**

$$
[Final equation] \tag{1}
$$

[Label for cross-referencing: use `\tag{N.M}` where N = chapter number, M = equation number]

**Dimensional Analysis:** [Verify units are consistent, e.g., "[m/s²] = [m/s²]"]

### Equation 2: [If applicable - include ≥50% of equations with full derivations per Constitution Principle IV]

[Repeat structure]

## Summary

[Concise 2-3 paragraph recap of the chapter's key points. Reinforce how the concepts connect to Physical AI and humanoid robotics applications.]

## Review Questions
